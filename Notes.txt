Form Validation using Regex

    Regular expressions are patterns that provide a way to search and                         
    a text

    regexp consits of:- a pattern and optional flags
    Creating reg:-
        "long" syntax == using the new keyword
        "short" === using slashes "/"

        slashes tell JavaScript that a regexp is being created
        NB: play the same role as quotes for strings
            pattern using slashes does not allow for expressions to be inserted
            used when we know the reg expression at code writing time

            new RegExp - used when we need to create a regexp 'on the fly' from
                         a dynamically generated string

    Flags
     6 of them in JavaScript

     i - the search is case sensitive: no diff btn A and a
     g - the search looks for all matches, without it only the first match is returned
     m - multiline mode
     s - enables the "dotall" mode, allow a dot . to match newline character \n
     u - enables full unicode support. Enables correct processing of surrogate pairs
     y - "Sticky" mode: searching the exact position in the text


    Searching: str.match
        method === str.match(regexp) - finds all matches of a regexp in the string
